							<!--p>
								Most data-driven discovery occurs through screening of chemical space, focusing on 
								structure-property relationships and generation of libraries of structurally-related analogues. 
								My research has focused instead on process space, linking properties to synthetic variables, 
								independent of structure. Work in chemical space often relies heavily on simulation to broaden 
								the searchable space, but simulation is necessarily limited, and practical exploration is still 
								important in exploration focused on the discovery of novelty.
							</p-->

							<p>
								<b>Exploring for Novelty</b> | Chemical discovery is often focused in chemical space - predicting whether a structure will
								display a given property (based on intuition or simulation) and then trying to illuminate routes to this target. However, 
								this strategy requires a certain amount of prior data to inform the prediction. I work to design new algorithm-directed 
								strategies to screen process spaces to discover novel substances, without function being used to direct this search. 
								Running experiments without knowing what the product may be introduces further challenges, including engineering 
								serendipity into the exploration, quantifying novelty, and dealing with difficulties arising from attempting to characterise
								impure systems.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Search Space Design</b> | Some of the challenges of exploring for novelty can be met by intelligent search space design. 
								The choice of which variables can be altered during the exploration, and by how much, is heavily informed by human intuition
								and heuristics, and this is difficult to quantify and teach to a digital agent. I am trying to codify this into frameworks 
								to enable digital chemists to design their exploration experiments effectively, devise digital strategies to design search 
								spaces, and through clarity, allow the underlying assumptions to be challenged and further probed.
							</p>

							<!--p>
								<b>Linking Chemical and Process Spaces</b> | 
							</p-->

							<p>
								<b>Digital Characterisation and Metric Design</b> | In order to enable closed loop chemical discovery, it is necessary for 
								automated systems to be able to access, transform, and quantify data recorded by typical spectroscopic techniques. 
								I build pipelines to interpret these data sources, and metrics to allow search algorithms to make decisions based on the 
								information contained within. Digital interpretation offers certain advantages over human operators in terms of dataset size
								and pattern finding, which I have exploited this in the deconvolution of complex system spectra.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Risk Management</b> | Data science has a huge potential in the creation of new tools for chemical laboratories. My work 
								in this area has centred on tools to take advantage of the wealth of safety data freely-available online, with the intention 
								of improving risk quantification and management in chemical inventories. Aims include the rational segregation of highly 
								hazardous substances, ensuring correct storage conditions for sensitive materials, and improving risk management for 
								vulnerable parties (e.g. pregnant people).

							<h2>Automated Interpretation of Analytics</h2>
							<p>
								<b>Digitising Characterisation and Metrics</b> | In order to enable closed loop chemical discovery, it is necessary for 
								automated systems to be able to access, transform, and quantify data recorded by typical spectroscopic techniques. 
								I build pipelines to interpret these data sources, and metrics to allow search algorithms to make decisions based on the 
								information contained within.

								<b>Deconvolution of Complex Spectra</b> | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis dapibus rutrum facilisis. Class aptent 
								taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Etiam tristique libero eu nibh 
								porttitor fermentum. Nullam venenatis erat id vehicula viverra. Nunc ultrices eros ut ultricies condimentum. 
							</p>
							
							<h2>Data Science and Cheminformatics</h2>
							<p>
								<b>Process Databases</b> | My key interest in this area is the development and application of databases based on synthetic
								procedures. Synthetic data is often difficult to access and interpret, and simply constructing 
								these databases is highly challenging. Once created, such datasets have a high potential utility
								in the development of synthetic routes to new or existing targets amongst other things.
							</p><p>
								<b>Risk Management</b> | I also have a secondary interest in the practical application of data science to build tools
								for chemical laboratories. Thus far, this has centred on tools to take advantage of the wealth
								of safety data freely-available online, with the intention of improving risk quantification 
								and management in chemical inventories. Aims include the rational segregation of highly 
								hazardous substances, ensuring correct storage conditions for sensitive materials, and 
								improving risk management for vulnerable parties (e.g. pregnant people).
